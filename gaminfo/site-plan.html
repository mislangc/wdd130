      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The Home Page is gonna be the front page for the audience to view. Letting my audience know the vast of world of gaming. Games are all around and can be played in many platforms such as Playstation, Xbox, Mobile and PC. Every platform is accompanied by it's corresponding image and a brief description about it. Gamers are connected in one way whether which platform or platforms they're using, that is, games. This website contains walkthroughs, tips, tricks, guides, strategies, and answers to games you find hard to complete. It is very important for a gamer to be challenged but beyond their ability, our site can help you reach that beyond. Games are one way of relaxation, critical thinking, seeing the beauty of technology, development of more games, social, programming inspiration, strong urge to be challenged and many more. You are not alone, for the world of games is not far within your reach.

      <h3>Games</h3>
      <p>
        Page 2 will have the title of "Games". Where the audience will have the opportunity to find the game they're looking for. A search bar would be nice to add in this page. Since this is the start of developing a personal site or a site like this, I'll be only showcasing 4 games in the body of this page and among the 4 will have 1 working link. That 1 working link will be my Page 3 for my personal site and it's gonna be called "Albion Online". The hover function will be implemented in each of the games images which will make them expand to add more design. With so less time and a wide variety of games, I only chose 4 games that I'm currently playing and played recently. The 4 games will be labeled in this order "Albion Online", "Genshin Impact", "Specimen Zero" and "Stumble Guys". The display:grid will be used for the parent element in the arrangement for these 4 games. Colors may be adjusted according to the images color for each games to make it pleasing to the eye. Games have different genres like action, rpg, open-world, horror, arcade, puzzle, board games, 3D, 2D, turn-based, card-game, MOBA and simulator. Games can also be educational like car simulator, cooking, house building, painting, question and answer and of course, mathematics. The question stands for you, what game will you play?

      <h3>Albion Online</h3>
      <p>
        Page 3 will have the title of "Albion Online". This page will not be in the navigation bar instead is found in the body of the "Games" page. This page will contain information about the game such as character customization, weapons, equipments, terrain, cities, resources, tiers and others. With so many things going on in the game, I might just be including a few from the list that I mentioned. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Albion Online is a sandbox MMORPG where you can write your own story. There no classes in this game, yet you can arrange your equipment as you wish and as you want depending on your gameplay. Armors are categorized into three: headgear, body armor and boots. There are 3 types of armors called plate armor, leather armor and cloth armor. Plate armors have strong defence but lacks greatly in damage boost. Leather armors are good for agile players and has a decent amount of damage boost but lacks a little bit in defence. While cloth armors has a great amount of damage boost and healing but lacks greatly on defence. You play your style.
