        <p>Hi everyone. I'd like to introduce myself. I'm from the Philippines. I've been a member of the Church since I was born. I served my mission in the Philippines Legazpi Mission. </p>
        <p>I am not married. Currently, I'm also unemployed so, I have my parents providing me with financial aid and I'm playing an online game as well to increase my finances, even though it's not enough, at least it's better than nothing. But I'm striving to be independent. Hoping that during or after this BYU-Idaho path, that I'm taking, could provide me greater opportunities to achieve an independent life.   </p>
        <p>I look forward to working with you all.</p>
